# EyeZ
This repository is currently being updated. The code available here is consistent with what was used for the experiments described in the paper "A Comprehensive Investigation into Sclera Biometrics: A Novel Dataset and Performance Study". When it's complete, the new version will be available [here](https://github.com/MatejVitek/EyeZ).
